  This was a system developed to manage the utilization of official vehicles in 
  State Department of Education of Amap√°, Brazil. It's objective was to organize
  vehicle booking, see current locations, routes and gas cost, avoiding misuse, 
  combustible theft, disorganization of the schedule and unecessary work in the
  Transport and Service Management Unit.
  It was active from 2014 to 2017, being discontinued after the department decided
  to outsource its transportation services.

## Comments
- The frontend style didn't age well, considering that it is from the Web 2.0 era
- Although the project was a success, this is legacy code, so there are performance issues, long queries, discontinued gems and outdated concepts.
  It is here just to show you my first practical application, please take this into consideration when evaluating.
